## Conceptual Understanding

DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is a two stranded genetic molecule consisting of 4 nucleic bases:
- Adenine (A)
- Thymine (T)
- Cytosine (C)
- Guanine (G)

A - T

C - G

DNA mocules have the capacity to store, transmit, and process information by combining its chemical capabilities with classical crytography

Encryption:
plain text -> encryption algorithm (encryption key) -> cipher text

Decryption:
cipher text -> decryption algorithm (encryption key) -> plain text

Advantages of DNA Encyrption:
- parralelism (in vitro = test tube DNA)
- massive storage capacity (1 gram = 1021 DNA bases = 108 TB)

Types of crytosystems:
1. symmetric (same key)
2. asymmetric (differnt keys to encrypt and decrypt)

## Cybersecurity Concepts

Types of encryption attacks
1. Cipher-text only attack (COA): tries to extract plaintext or key with access to cipher text
2. Known plain-text attack (KPA): tries to extract secret keys and code books using plaintext and encrypted cipher text
3. Chosen Plaintext Attack (CPA): tries to extract secret info by accessing random ciphertext and getting corresponding encrypted ciphertext
4. Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA): access the cipher text and figure out the plaintext


## Crypto Concepts

### One Time Pads (OTP)

Binary additive stream cipher (one bit of plaintext is encrypted at a time using XOR addition)

Example Encryption:

DNA:         0101 1110 0010
Random Key:  1010 0111 0001
Cipher Text: 1111 1001 0011

Example Decryption:
Cipher Text: 1111 1001 0011
Key:         1010 0111 0001
Plain Text:  0101 1110 0010

### Psuedo Random Number Generators (PNRGs)

### Basic Implementations of DNA Encryption
1. DNA Subsitution using Randomly Generated Distinct Pad represented by DNA strands
2. Bit-wise XOR with molecular computation

#### Implementation A: DNA Substitution with Integrated One Time Padding

1. Feed in binary input represented by DNA strands of n length split into fixed length segments
2. Get a code book library full of long DNA pads including random mappings from plaintext to ciphertext
3.
