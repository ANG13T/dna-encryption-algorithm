## Conceptual Understanding

DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is a two stranded genetic molecule consisting of 4 nucleic bases:
- Adenine (A)
- Thymine (T)
- Cytosine (C)
- Guanine (G)

A - T

C - G

DNA mocules have the capacity to store, transmit, and process information by combining its chemical capabilities with classical crytography

Encryption:
plain text -> encryption algorithm (encryption key) -> cipher text

Decryption:
cipher text -> decryption algorithm (encryption key) -> plain text
